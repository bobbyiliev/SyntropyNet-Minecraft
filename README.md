## ðŸ“œ Installation

The installation is fully automated so you don't really have to do any server configuration. 

However before you get started you will need the following things:

* A [Syntropy Account](https://syntropystack.com)
  * Once you have the Account get an **Agent token** and set the expiry date somewhere in the future as per this [guide here](https://docs.syntropystack.com/docs/get-your-agent-token).
  * Then get an **Access token** as well as per the instructions [here](https://docs.syntropystack.com/docs/access-tokens).

* [A DigitalOcean account](https://m.do.co/c/2a9bba940f39). If you use this link you will get free $100 credit to spin up your own servers:

  * Once you have your DigitalOcean account, create an API token as per the [steps here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/).
  * [Create an Ubuntu 20.04 server](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) with at least 2GB RAM (4GB is better).

Finally once you have the tokens ready, [SSH to your new server](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) and run the following commands:

> Note: update the tokes accordingly!

```
export SYNTROPY_AGENT_TOKEN=YOUR_SYNTROPY_AGENT_TOKEN_HERE
export SYNTROPY_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_SYNTROPY_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
export DO_API_KEY=YOUR_DO_API_KEY_HERE
```

* Finally clone this repository and run the install script with this command:

```
git clone git@github.com:bobbyiliev/SyntropyNet-Minecraft /var/www/syntropynet ; cd /var/www/syntropynet ; time bash infrastructure/install
```

> Note: this process could take up to 5-10 minutes depending on the size of your server.

Once the installation has been completed visit your server IP via your browser and you will be able to login with the following default login details:

```
user = admin@admin.com
pass = password
```

> Make sure to change the login details as soon as possible!
