## üìú Installation

The installation is fully automated so you don't really have to do any server configuration. 

However before you get started you will need the following things:

* A [Syntropy Account](https://syntropystack.com)
  * Once you have the Account get an **Agent token** and set the expiry date somewhere in the future as per this [guide here](https://docs.syntropystack.com/docs/get-your-agent-token).
  * Then get an **Access token** as well as per the instructions [here](https://docs.syntropystack.com/docs/access-tokens).

* [A DigitalOcean account](https://m.do.co/c/2a9bba940f39). If you use this link you will get free $100 credit to spin up your own servers:
[![DigitalOcean Referral Badge](https://web-platforms.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%203.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2a9bba940f39&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)

  * Once you have your DigitalOcean account, create an API token as per the [steps here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/).
  * [Create an Ubuntu 20.04 server](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) with at least 2GB RAM (4GB is better).

Finally once you have the tokens ready, [SSH to your new server](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) and run the following commands:

> Note: update the tokes accordingly!

```
export SYNTROPY_AGENT_TOKEN=YOUR_SYNTROPY_AGENT_TOKEN_HERE
export SYNTROPY_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_SYNTROPY_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
export DO_API_KEY=YOUR_DO_API_KEY_HERE
```

* Finally clone this repository and run the install script with this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/bobbyiliev/SyntropyNet-Minecraft /var/www/syntropynet ; cd /var/www/syntropynet ; time bash infrastructure/install
```

> Note: this process could take up to 5-10 minutes depending on the size of your server.

## Usage

Once the installation has been completed, add your first MC server by running these two commands:

* Switch to the `syntropy` user:

```
su syntropy
```

* Create a new server:
* 
```
bash /var/www/syntropynet/infrastructure/add.sh
```


Then visit your server IP via your browser and you will be able to login with the following default login details:

```
user = admin@admin.com
pass = password
```

> Make sure to change the login details as soon as possible!

To create a new server visit the dashboard at `your_ip/dashboard` and in order to add a new server just hit the `Add server` button.

This will provision a new MC server and do all of the necessary configuration including:

* Create a new DigitalOcean Ubuntu server
* Install Docker
* Start the Syntropy Agent with the Syntropy Agent token from your `.env` file
* Start a new MC instance
* Update the BugneeCord proxy configuration to include the new server

### Shell Scripts

For anyone who prefers the CLI rather than the MC panel UI, you could run the following commands in order to add and remove servers:

First switch to the syntropy user:

```
su syntropy
```

* Adding a server:

```
bash /var/www/syntropynet/infrastructure/add.sh
```

* Removing a server:

```
bash /var/www/syntropynet/infrastructure/remove.sh SERVER_NAME_HERE
```

Usually this takes up to a couple of minutes for the whole process to finish.
